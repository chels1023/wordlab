# wordlab

StudyPlan.pages is meant to help me practice formatting on pages. It is also helping me make a schedule for my classes in my first semester of cegep. It is also meant to help me practice how to make several changes over time on a document and commit the same document. 

StudyPlan.pdf is meant to help me practice adding new files to the same git repository.
